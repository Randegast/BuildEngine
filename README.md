<h2>BuildEngine</h2>

BuildEngine is a 2D Java Game Library.
BuildEngine makes programming in Java a lot easier by providing all sorts of utilities and a robust understandable structure. 
This way you can focus on programming your game, and BuildEngine takes care of the boring stuff.
<br><br>
This version of the engine uses the build in java graphics library (AWT) for rendering. This version is the most stable.
Features:
 - A collection of core abstract classes based on ECS, capable of creating any game (see core-architecture).
 - Supports animations, custom rendering, but also an elaborate implementation for default rendering.
 - An advanced collision system, using SAT. Also a basic physics implementation. Both are customizable.
 - <i>A lot</i> of pre-made Directors and Components. 
 - Java rendering using an custom advanced Draw class, handling resizing, unit scaling and rotation.
 - Audio like sound effects and music handling.
 - Configuration file I/O, for easy writing and retrieving data.
 - The input system is capable of detecting press, hold and release for key and mouse plus many more features.
 - A small math library, containing full Vector2 clases, shapes and transforms used for the collision system.
 - Static event scheduler, so you can start timed or repeating events anywere.
 - Asset handling, like reading and saving in chache.
 - Easy and fun to program in :)
